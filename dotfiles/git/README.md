# Git config & ignore

## Easy ignore

All filenames beginning with a tilde (`~`) will be ignored by git. e.g. `~TODO.txt`

This way you can place files related to a project but still personal inside that project's repo folder, without adding it to that repo's `.gitignore` for everyone else to see.
